# Minecraft-LTS-Launcher
Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 standalone launcher intended for offline use far into the future (Long Term Service)

[Please go here for the full build!](https://mega.nz/folder/3A9h0IbK#dT_B3DR3XgOLQABWjwtczw)

There is a build also here in the build folder that has a a large, likely unused, library from inside java 8 removed (jfxwebkit.dll) in order to fit in githubs file size limits. It should work fine too but no guarentees so I recommend using the build from mega (the link above) or making your own.

This project is intended as a means to aid in the longevity and preservation of the most nostolgic and influential version of minecraft, beta 1.7.3 from 2011

No copyright infringement is intended since this is a version that is over 10 years old but it is technically a redistribution so I assume it may be taken down from github.

Features:
* Select a username
* Select max ram
* Toggle on and off the 2 most important mods, Too Many Items and Aether
* Export server file to run a server

Packaged inside of the program is also java 8, which is required to run the aether mod correctly, so if you run this on Windows it will run the program using the included java jdk8u51 x64 rather than what java you may have installed.
If you are running on linux you may need to find a java 8 installation to use or modify the source code as necessary.


Please stash on a flash drive and enjoy with your kids in 30 years...
