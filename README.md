For the executable please see the builds folder!

This project is intended as a means to aid in the longevity of the most nostolgic and influential version of minecraft, beta 1.7.3 from 2011

No copyright infringement is intended since this is a version that is over 10 years old but it is technically a redistribution so I assume it may be taken down from github.

Features:
* Select a username
* Select max ram
* Toggle on and off the 2 most important mods, Too Many Items and Aether
* Export server file to run a server

Packaged inside of the program is also java 8, which is required to run the aether mod correctly, so if you run this on Windows it will run the program using the includes java jdk8u51 x64 rather than what java you may have installed.
If you are running on linux you may need to find a java 8 installation to use or modify the source code as necessary.


Please stash on a flash drive and enjoy with your kids in 30 years...
